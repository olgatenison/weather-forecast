# Weather Forecast

Weather Forecast is a web application that provides real-time weather information for a selected city. Users can input the name of a city in the provided form, and the application will send a request to a weather API to fetch and display the current temperature, feels like temperature, cloud conditions, and humidity. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and integrates with a weather API to retrieve weather data. The design of the user interface, including its mobile-responsive layout, was developed by me.
